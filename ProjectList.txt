Put ideas for projects here:
	* simple reddit bot
	* text based game
	* quiz maker - takes questions from a file and puts together a quiz
	* mp3 tagger
	* hangman
	* sudoku
	* chess

Things that need to be worked on
	* Organizing the subreddit and writing things down in the sidebar
	
	* Finding a public ventrilo/teamspeak server for now to voice 
	communicate during events. If things take off, I wouldn't mind 
	paying for a dedicated server.

	* Creating a guide for people interested
	rules and guidelines for the events

Put ongoing projects here:
	* Reddit Bot
	* IRC
