# Progects
Anything to do with /r/Progects, the only subreddit dedicated to virtual hackathons. As a friendly programming community focused on group projects, we're hoping for monthly programming sessions in small groups over the world wide web. 

Our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/) will be #Progects @ Freenode

Current Work is being done on the reddit bot in Python 3 with PRAW

Current bot pabilities:
 * Bot name is PROGECTS_BOT1
 * Can register users as self or teams
 * If a user wants to join someone else's team, they can if the team is not full (5 Maximum)
 * Bot will send out reminers to previously registered and currently registered people of new events,
   24 hours to an event, 1 hour before an event and 10 minutes before the event starts.
 * The commands available for the bot are:
      !help - Bot responds with help text explaining the commands
      !notify - registers users for reminders
      !register (arguments) - registers users for events/reminders and can register teams
      !unregister - Removes user from registry and/or reminder notifications
      !team - Let's you know who's in your team


Current short term goals:
* Create well formatted messages for the bot
* IRC capabilities
* Notify users of new team mates

  

Goals for /r/Progects! To get the ball rolling, this is what I want to accomplish before actually starting:

* Project Ideas
* Organizing the subreddit and writing things down in the sidebar
* Finding a public ventrilo/teamspeak server for now to voice communicate during events. If things take off, I wouldn't mind paying for a dedicated server. 
* Starting an IRC channel and organizing that. - Starting with this one first
* Creating a guide for people interested
* rules and guidelines for the events
