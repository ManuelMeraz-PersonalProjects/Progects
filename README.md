# Progects
Anything to do with /r/Progects, the only subreddit dedicated to virtual hackathons. As a friendly programming community focused on group projects, we're hoping for monthly programming sessions in small groups over the world wide web. 

Goals for /r/Progects!

To get the ball rolling, this is what I want to accomplish before actually starting:
  
  * Project Ideas
  * Organizing the subreddit and writing things down in the sidebar
  * Finding a public ventrilo/teamspeak server for now to voice communicate during events. If things take off, I wouldn't mind      paying for a dedicated server.
  * Starting an IRC channel and organizing that. - Starting with this one first
  * Creating a guide for people interested 
  * rules and guidelines for the events
  * A reddit bot to help organize the events. It will create a thread the day before the event. People could PM the bot with certain arguments and the bot would register them for the event based on the input. The bot would also send reminders to people registered to the subreddit for upcoming dates. This is a project I'd like to work on before starting anything. Also add anything else that would help.
  
  
  Our IRC channel is @ Freenode #Progects
