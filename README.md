# Progects
Anything to do with /r/Progects, the only subreddit dedicated to virtual hackathons. As a friendly programming community focused on group projects, we're hoping for monthly programming sessions in small groups over the world wide web. 

Our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/) will be #Progects @ Freenode

Current Work is being done on the reddit bot in Python 3 with PRAW

Current short term goals:
  * Read thread titles for upcoming events
  * Create teams once date is met for thread title
  

  
Eventually:
  
  * If error occurs, create log file and email it
  
Current Bugs:
  * Does not correctly organize people into teams. Put everyone on Team_1 until it's full
  then it creates Team_2.
  

Goals for /r/Progects! To get the ball rolling, this is what I want to accomplish before actually starting:

* Project Ideas
* Organizing the subreddit and writing things down in the sidebar
* Finding a public ventrilo/teamspeak server for now to voice communicate during events. If things take off, I wouldn't mind paying for a dedicated server. 
* Starting an IRC channel and organizing that. - Starting with this one first
* Creating a guide for people interested
* rules and guidelines for the events
