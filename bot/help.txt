    Don't forget to refresh your inbox for replies.

    The commands that are available are:
        !register:
                   Use this command to register yourself or a team
                   to the event. Include the language and experience
                   level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) if you 
                   are registering yourself. If you are registering as 
                   a team, then simply include the usernames of your
                    teammates. You can also register in the same team 
                    as a friend if their team isn't full.
                    
                   The register command will also add you to the reminder
                    list, which means that you will receive reminders for
                    the upcoming event and for future events.
                   
                   If you would like to change something such as the
                   language, then use the !register command again and
                   it will override your past settings.
                   
                    If you would like to be
                   removed, simply use the command !unregister.
                   
                   .
                   Examples:
                            !register me as a python beginner
                            !register self python advanced
                            !register me using c++ as an intermediate user
                            !register me on the same team as /u/user
                            !register my team /u/user1 and /u/user2
                            !register my own team /u/user1, /u/user2, /u/user3
                            !register me with /u/user
        
        !unregister:
                    Use this command to unregister from the event
                    and be removed from the notifications list.
                    
                    Example:
                            !unregister
        
        !team:
                    Returns the users in your team. If you are in a custom
                    team it will return the usernames only. If you registered
                    by yourself, you can see who is currently on your team.
                
                    Example:
                            !team
                            
        !notify:
                    If you would like to be kept updated, but can't participate
                    in the next event, then use this command. You will be
                    added to the notifications list. If you would like to
                    unsubcribe from the notifications, then use the 
                    !unregister command.
                    
                    Example:
                            !notify
